# The Famous Lambdacats!

The lambdacats are a fork of [lolcats] that generally involve humor from
[Haskell], [functional programming], [type systems], and other related subjects.

[lolcats]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat
[Haskell]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)
[functional programming]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
[type systems]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system

This is my service to the community, and, as such, I welcome all contributions,
including (but not limited to) adding new lambdacats, updating the information
on the existing ones, and finding lost lambdacats.

For technical information on the website, see the documentation on [lambdacats

This comment inspired what could be either the beginning of an infectious
Haskell recruitment campaign, or just a sign that some of us are mad. I present
the lambdacats:

In August 2010, I [created][2] `https://spl.smugmug.com/Humor/Lambdacats` in an
attempt to preserve them for posterity. I have culled from sources far and wide
to develop this collection, which now contains many of the originals as well as
many images inspired by or similar to the Lambdacats.

In August 2019, I ended my SmugMug subscription and created this
~~repository~~shelter to continue the preservation project.
