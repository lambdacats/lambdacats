# The Famous Lambdacats!

The lambdacats are a category of [lolcats] that generally involve humor about
[Haskell], [functional programming], [type systems], and other related subjects.

This collection has been culled from sources far and wide. It now contains most
of the originals as well as many other images inspired by or similar to the
lambdacats.

This is a service to the community, and, as such, I welcome all contributions,
including (but not limited to) adding new lambdacats, updating the information
on the existing ones, and finding lost lambdacats.

For technical information on the website, see the [administration

In August 2010, over a year after the [last lambdacat sighting], I
[created][created2] `https://spl.smugmug.com/Humor/Lambdacats/` in an attempt to
preserve them for posterity.

I ended my SmugMug subscription in August 2019 and created
[`https://lambdacats.github.io/`] as a ~~repository~~shelter to continue the
preservation project.
