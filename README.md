# Lambdacats

The famous Lambdacats! The concept originated with the photoblog
`http://arcanux.org/lambdacats.html`, which is no longer available. In an
attempt to preserve them for posterity, I have culled from sources far and wide
to develop this collection, which contains many of the originals as well as many
images inspired by or similar to the Lambdacats.

Notes:

* This is a work-in-progress migration from
  `https://spl.smugmug.com/Humor/Lambdacats`, which I no longer pay for.
* I started with [GitHub Gallery] but expect things to change dramatically.
* Contributions are welcome!
